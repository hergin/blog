Let me set the record straight. I don't like online education and virtual instruction of any class I am teaching. It sucks the best out of the in-person classes, which, in my opinion, are the personal time with students and the instant feedback while teaching. Instant feedback is rather important for a healthy teaching environment. I can understand if students like/understand the topic and want more of it. I can also understand who is shy and can't ask a question, yet they have some. I can approach them easily right after the class, which I can't do it in any online or virtual instruction. However, I think online learning is suitable for a topic that you already know a little bit and want to improve yourself. For any new topic, in-person interaction time is the best. That's my personal take. We might be on different pages, and I can respect that.

Nevertheless, we are forced to do things online [under the circumstances](https://www.bsu.edu/news/press-center/archives/2020/3/covid-19). Luckily, computer science classes are among the ones that have the most advanced technical students and instructors. So, I didn't have too many problems to adapt to the new situation. Lots of instructors around the world are sharing their experience in the transition process. Here is mine.

## Initial change
Of course, I had to do some modifications to the class structure. First, I converted everything to virtual immediately, meaning that I met with my students at the same time as regular classes but virtually. I was taking attendance, and the rest of the things were pretty much the same.

## More changes
After I got more emails about the situation from the university, I agreed with them, and I decided to record my virtual classes as well and make it available for asynchronous studying. I recorded the classes at the same time as regular classes. I usually set a 5% attendance grade in the syllabus. I decided to make attendance optional and give them full in terms of this assignment grade. However, as a teacher, I still want some interaction time. So, I decided to give a bonus to whoever attends to my virtual classes while I am recording it. Luckily, more than half of my class still attend virtual classes, which yields to a more productive and interactive class.

## Tools
I use [WebEx](https://www.webex.com/) for giving the virtual lectures and recording them. Because our university has a contract. Of course, like any other conferencing software, WebEx also had trouble at first. So, I kept [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) around for a quick fallback when I had trouble with WebEx. Now, WebEx works more stable.

WebEx can record both the webcam and screen share in a good way. After each class, I first save it to local and upload it to my youtube channel. My experiences with WebEx Cloud didn't go well, so I decided to try this approach.

I used [SketchTogether](https://sketchtogether.com/) a few times for writing and drawing something together with the students. It was decent. However, now, if I need to draw something, I use a physical board that I have at home and share it on webcam. See below:

## Virtual office hours
I announced to my students that I would be available virtually on my regular office hours. I still didn't get a single person attended, but I am hopeful. I set my office hours via WebEx again.

## Increasing interaction
One small bit I want to share is about how I am taking attendance. We start with mics muted and webcams off. Even though, I see the names of the students, I still call their names at the beginning of the class and let them say "here" or "present" via their mic. I like to think that even this kind of small interaction makes a big change, rather than just sitting and watching a virtual class.
