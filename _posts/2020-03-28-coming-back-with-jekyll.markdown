After Medium starts to go crazy with its ads and login popups and [all weird stuff happening](http://studyhall.xyz/blog/2018/6/12/mediums-mess-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-site-that-was-supposed-to-save-journalism), I decided to continue blogging using a static blog generator using GitHub. For now, this seems to be the most viable approach to blogging for some technical person. We will see eachother more once I get my act together. Cheers.

This is the technical stuff I am using in this blog.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): Static site generator
* [Zolan](https://github.com/artemsheludko/zolan): Jekyll theme
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll): For built-in jekyll hosting support
* [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com): For perfect free pictures
* [UnDraw](https://undraw.co/): For perfect free illustrations
* [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/): Simple and my favorite photo editing tool
